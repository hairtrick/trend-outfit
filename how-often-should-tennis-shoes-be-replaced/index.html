<p>The exact answer will depend on a number of factors, but in general, experts recommend replacing your sneakers every 300 to 500 miles (thatâs helpful if you use an app to track your runs) or every six to eight months, whichever comes first. Experts recommend you replace your running shoes every 500 to 750 kilometers. Your weight is also a factorâthe more you weigh, the faster your shoes will wear out. According to verywellfit, most of the work shoes will need to be replaced after 500 miles. How Often Should I Replace My Tennis Shoes? Yes We Foot.</p>
