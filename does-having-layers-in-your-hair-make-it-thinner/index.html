<p>My hairdresser told me that layers make your hair thicker I have thick hair too. After layering it might take a while to grow your hair out. The perfect length of a haircut is up to your chest level and the layers should begin either above your chin or below it so that the layered strands could. Does short hair make you look fatter.
