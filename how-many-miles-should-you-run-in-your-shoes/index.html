Your shoes have poor shock absorption compared to when they were new. After that, they lose maximum support and shock absorption, which may leave you vulnerable to injury. Swapping out shoes at 400 or 500 miles is probably still a good idea, but don’t swap out an aging shoe because you liked how it felt fresh out of the box—shoot for shoes that feel good on your feet after 100 or 200 miles of running, since this is when a shoe starts to “bottom out” in its cushioning loss.</p>
