<p>Suitable for long distance and rough terrain running, the cortez gained a lot of popularity during the olympics. Nike cortez is one of the classic shoe designs, a true sneaker jewel that was born in 1972. The concept was designed by olympic coach bill bowerman and it became the official track shoe for that season. Nike has released the classic blue, white, and red cortez, available on the official website to celebrate the iconic running shoe and its rich history in mainstream cinema and sporting events.
