<p>In most if not all salons the colourist dyes your hair first before sending you off to the stylist for a hair cut. Should i dye my hair before or after cutting it. No cut your hair first then dye your hair. Should I Color My Hair Before a Holiday Vacation or After.

<p>Im having my hair trimmed at the hairdressers later this week but i have bought a semi hair dye to do at home. Depending on the dye you might end up with split ends so if its long it wont be so bad. So the question is to i dye the hair first and then get the hair cut or can i get the hair cut first and then dye. Coloring hair damages it a lot and its good to cut the new damage off the ends.
