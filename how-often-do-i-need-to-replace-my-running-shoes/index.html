<p>Generally speaking, you should be changing your athletic running shoes when you reach 300 to 450 miles. If your exercise routine consists of walking 30 minutes a day, or an average of 3 to 4 hours a week, consider replacing your shoes every six months. If you are an avid runner, you can usually estimate the life of your shoe considering the distance you run and how you run (trails, treadmills, etc). Most women runners are lighter than men so their shoes will also tend to last a bit longer and they should get closer to 1000km’s or 650 miles on them. If you’ve found your way to this article, I’m guessing you.</p>

<p>But how do you know when to replace your shoes? When to replace walking shoes: If your usual run feels more arduous or takes longer than usual (or both), a replacement pair of running shoes should be on the horizon. If you’ve ran that much, kudos! The match is one of the most significant things to think.</p>
