<p>1 Always blow-dry your fringe straight away - Your fringe naturally dries quickly and can begin to set right before youve had a chance to find your trusty hair protector spray. After a hair cut clip your fringes on one side. All you need to do next is wait until your bangs dry naturally. To balance your pretty heart face opt for a fringe that is slightly shorter in the centre and longer at the cheekbones like the curtain fringe.
