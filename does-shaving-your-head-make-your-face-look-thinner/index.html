<p>When you gain weight the fat tends to accumulate in your cheeks and jawline making your face seem rounder softer and also shorter and thats the trio that is responsible for a fat looking face. Keep your sideburns neat by trimming them frequently with facial hair scissors. The shorter bang would absolutely work for a square face. Plus it does not take that much volume out of thin hair as it is such a small section that is shaved. Pin By Leonard Tepayev On Beauty Cool Hair Color Hot Hair Styles Look Thinner.</p>
