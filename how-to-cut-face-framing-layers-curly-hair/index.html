<p>To do this youll want to ask for soft wispy long layers. I LIke a couple pumps of Moroccan Oil as a leave in or the Sallys One and Only brand due to price and Redken Ringlets 07 as a gel. Customize these low-maintenance layers just how you like it and pair them with your signature cut. Curl Keeper Original will control your curls without adding weight.
