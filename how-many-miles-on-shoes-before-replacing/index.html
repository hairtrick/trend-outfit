<p>If you ask the big shoe brands how often you should replace your running kicks, they’re going to give you a mileage estimate. As a general rule, replace your running shoes after 300 to 500 miles (three to six months, depending on how much you run). To monitor your distance traveled, simply employ an activity tracking device to measure the number of miles you cover on each run, then keep a tally of the overall number of miles for each pair of shoes. Hiking boots last longer when you keep them clean and dry! Vivobarefoot Motus My Favorite Trail Running And Mountain.</p>
