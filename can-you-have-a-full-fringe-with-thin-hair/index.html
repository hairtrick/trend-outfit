<p>Often times men feel limited to the types of styles they can wear due to their hair being very fine and thin. Many curly-haired ladies find bangs difficult to manage but even the wildest of curls can get away with long side bangs.

Also an easy to maintain haircut but beautiful and classy nonetheless. Pin On Fringes.</p>
