<p>Cover a sleeveless shirt with a sweater or add a shawl to a light blouse. If you are heading to a more creative job interview then I suggest you try yellow purple and pastel hues. Look for a shirt that has a structure interesting neckline detail or asymmetrical hemline. A pair of ankle or knee-high boots also work well with a more casual business outfit and theyll keep your feet warmer too.
